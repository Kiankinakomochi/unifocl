# Changelog

## 0.4.1 - 2026-03-09

### Patch Train
- `a2`: Protobuf-contract integration pass for hierarchy `mk` command typing and validation.

### Added
- Added `HierarchyMkType` enum to protobuf contracts (`external/unifocl-protobuf/contracts/hierarchy.proto`) as the shared source of truth for hierarchy create types.

### Changed
- Hierarchy `mk` / `make` command parsing now validates type tokens against protobuf-generated contract enum values.
- Hierarchy `mk` / `make` now normalize accepted aliases and send canonical contract type names to the daemon bridge.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-03-09

### Patch Train
- `a1`: Incremental development pass for hierarchy/inspector command completeness and typed object creation.

### Added
- Hierarchy mode now supports `make --type <type> [--count <count>]` and `mk <type> [count]`.
- Inspector mode now supports typed creation via `make`/`mk`.
- Typed `mk` object creation support for UI, 3D primitives, lights, 2D objects, camera/audio, and empty structural objects.
- `mk` suggestions and fuzzy matching now include common typed creation shortcuts directly in hierarchy IntelliSense.

### Changed
- Unified hierarchy command payload to carry typed create parameters (`type`, `count`) across CLI and Unity bridge.
- Inspector command metadata now documents typed `make`/`mk` forms.
- Standardized changelog file casing to `CHANGELOG.md` for GitHub tooling compatibility.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Hierarchy mode now provides in-prompt IntelliSense with command signatures, argument usage, and descriptions.
- Hierarchy mode prompt now supports suggestion navigation and insertion (`↑/↓` + `Enter`) plus `Esc` dismissal behavior.

### Changed
- Project composer IntelliSense now uses inspector-specific command suggestions while in inspector context.
- Inspector command suggestions now include context-specific command usage and explanations rather than only project-wide command listings.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-03-06

### Added
- New `/build` command suite and aliases:
  - `/build run [target] [--dev] [--debug] [--clean] [--path <output-path>]`
  - `/build exec <Method>`
  - `/build scenes`
  - `/build addressables [--clean] [--update]`
  - `/build cancel`
  - `/build targets`
  - `/build logs`
  - Aliases: `/b`, `/bx`, `/ba`
- Interactive build-target selection when target is omitted.
- Target install-then-build flow for missing modules.
- Build target caching (refresh on explicit install flow).
- In-terminal live build monitor with pinned status/log header.
- Restartable build log tail and cancelled-build log snapshot view.
- Build diagnostics expansion:
  - heartbeat and stall hints
  - last diagnostic / last exception reporting
  - log file path shown in monitor and summary

### Changed
- Build cancellation now performs daemon teardown and returns to Project mode after keypress.
- Build output routing now supports explicit `--path`.
- Default build outputs are isolated in timestamped folders to avoid artifact collisions.
- Main-thread dispatch safety improved for build execution and daemon stop paths.
- Added spinner/status UX for heavy build-related steps.

### Fixed
- Resolved Unity main-thread violation during daemon stop (`EditorApplication.Exit` off main thread).
- Improved resilience for detach/reattach with ongoing builds.
